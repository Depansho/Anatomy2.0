# Purpose of admins

The Anatomy 2.0 system decides between two kinds of users. Users are lecturers or students. The two roles differ only in certain rights, that are granted only to lecturers.

Lecturers can do the following things, that cannot be done by students:
1. Create courses and update / delete their own courses.
2. Upload models into the gallery
3. Enter the "lecturers mode" in course rooms. It is supposed to be used when holding lectures or presentations. It disables other users in the course room from navigating the model.

By default every user has a student account. Users can upgrade their account to a lecturer account by themselves. Admins will get notified via mail when a user upgrades his/her account.
