		      <b>How does upgrading to a lecturer account work?</b> <br>
		      Our admins will check whether you are a lecturer. If you are, they will upgrade your account to a lecturer account. Once your account has been upgraded, you will be informed by mail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What benefits do I have when using a lecturer account?</b><br>
          A lecturer account is required for creating your own courses, uploading models and presenting models in lecturer mode.
