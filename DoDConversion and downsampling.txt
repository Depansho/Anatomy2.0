Mesh Processing
 
The 3D Model used for collaborative viewing on the web is captured using 3D scanning using Breukmann scanSCAN and stitched together using Optocat software. The mesh obtained contains millions of triangles and have to be cleaned and down sampled before it could be used directly for the web.

Down-sampling:
For down sampling of the mesh, we use Meshlab which is an open source software.
The software is available at http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/ .
Optocat exports the 3D mesh as an STL/PLY file which can be easily imported by Meshlab for processing. In Meshlab we use filter “Quadratic Edge Collapse Decimation” for reducing the polygon count. It is also used for general cleaning of the 3D mesh.

Format Conversion:
Meshlab exports the down sampled and cleaned mesh as .wrl  format which is a file extension for a Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML). We have to convert it into X3D file extension that is used in X3DOM which is an open-source framework and runtime for 3D graphics on the Web. We use InstantReality for this.
The link to it : http://doc.instantreality.org/tools/x3d_encoding_converter/
 InstantReality is an online translator between ClassicVrml or XML (.wrl) encoding and can convert into X3DOM outputs (HTML5 or XHTML5).   We just paste the .wrl or .x3d file in it and it creates a html output. It could also be used offline in the similar way as Instant Reality installations include aopt, a local command-line converter.
