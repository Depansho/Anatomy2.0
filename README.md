Blended Learning with digital 3d models in Anatomy Education – Online pool for 3D Learning Objects in science and education

The aim of the project is to build an online pool of digital 3D models as ubiquitous available teaching and learning material. The models are high-resolution scanned digital copies of various physical objects used for many years in classical anatomy course learning. Due to the delicate nature and fragility of the physical learning objects their use in classical education was limited. The progress in 3D scanning technology in recent years has led to reduced cost and effort in the acquisition and reproduction of physical objects. The project intends to provide high-quality digital copies of a variety of learning objects used in classical anatomy course learning to facilitate learning scenarios outside the dissection hall (eg " bedside teaching" , seminars and POL ). The online pool will be accessible for tutors and students alike in the context of anatomy education at RWTH Aachen University Clinic and is a project of the ETS-Blended Learning program at RWTH Aachen University funded under the Excellence Initiative of the German Science Council.
